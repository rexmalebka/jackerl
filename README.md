jack
=====

An OTP library for jack audio interface, written using nif functions and jack API in C


Build
-----

    $ rebar3 compile


# Development and future

Might need jack C headers and rebar3 installed for development, I'm not a great C programmer so there must be a lot of bad practice done in this, please check `c_src` folder.
Any bug or improvement are welcomed.
